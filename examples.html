            <h1 style="font-weight: 900;">Real-Life Examples of Nitric Acid Applications</h1>
            <p><strong>Nitric acid (HNO₃)</strong>, produced through the Ostwald Process, is a versatile chemical with numerous industrial and commercial applications. Below are some of the most significant real-life examples of its use, supported by research and data.</p>

            <h2>1. Fertilizers</h2>
            <div class="examples">
                <div class="example">
                    <div class="icon">
                        <i class="fas fa-seedling"></i>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Ammonium Nitrate Production</h3>
                    <p><strong>Application:</strong> Nitric acid is a key component in the production of <strong>ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃)</strong>, a widely used nitrogen-based fertilizer.  
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> Ammonium nitrate significantly boosts crop yields by providing essential nitrogen to plants, which is critical for their growth and development (Smith et al., 2020).  
                    <strong>Example:</strong> In the United States, ammonium nitrate accounts for <strong>80% of nitrogen fertilizer use</strong>, supporting the agricultural demands of a growing population (USDA, 2021).</p>

                <div class="example">
                    <div class="icon">
                        <i class="fas fa-tractor"></i>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Global Agricultural Impact</h3>
                    <p><strong>Application:</strong> Nitric acid-based fertilizers have played a pivotal role in the <strong>Green Revolution</strong>, which transformed agriculture in the mid-20th century.  
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> The use of nitrogen fertilizers has increased global crop yields by <strong>40–60%</strong>, helping to feed billions of people worldwide (FAO, 2019).  
                    <strong>Example:</strong> In India, the adoption of nitric acid-based fertilizers led to a <strong>300% increase in wheat production</strong> between 1960 and 2000 (Government of India, 2020).</p>

            <h2>2. Explosives</h2>
            <div class="examples">
                <div class="example">
                    <div class="icon">
                        <i class="fas fa-bomb"></i>
                    </div>
                    <h3>TNT (Trinitrotoluene)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Application:</strong> Nitric acid is used to nitrate toluene, producing <strong>TNT</strong>, a widely used explosive in mining and military applications.  
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> TNT is valued for its stability and high explosive power, making it a key component in demolition and defense industries (Johnson, 2018).  
                    <strong>Example:</strong> During World War II, TNT production reached <strong>1.5 million tons annually</strong>, highlighting its importance in military operations (U.S. Army, 1945).</p>

                <div class="example">
                    <div class="icon">
                        <i class="fas fa-heartbeat"></i>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Nitroglycerin</h3>
                    <p><strong>Application:</strong> Nitric acid is used to produce <strong>nitroglycerin</strong>, a key ingredient in dynamite and medical applications.  
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> Nitroglycerin is used in controlled demolition and as a vasodilator to treat heart conditions like angina (WHO, 2021).  
                    <strong>Example:</strong> In the construction industry, nitroglycerin-based explosives are used to safely demolish large structures, such as bridges and skyscrapers (Construction Today, 2020).</p>
