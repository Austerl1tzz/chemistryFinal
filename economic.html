            <h1 style="font-weight: 900;">Economic Impact of the Ostwald Process</h1>
            <p>The <strong>Ostwald Process</strong> has significant economic implications, particularly in the production of <strong>nitric acid (HNO₃)</strong>, which is a cornerstone of several industries. Below are the key economic factors associated with this process.</p>

            <h2>1. Global Nitric Acid Market</h2>
            <div class="examples">
                <div class="example">
                    <h3>Market Size and Growth</h3>
                    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The global nitric acid market is valued at <strong>$10 billion</strong> and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of <strong>3.5%</strong> from 2021 to 2028 (Grand View Research, 2021).  
                    <strong>Drivers:</strong> The demand for nitric acid is driven by its use in fertilizers, explosives, and industrial chemicals.  
                    <strong>Example:</strong> In 2020, the Asia-Pacific region accounted for <strong>45%</strong> of global nitric acid consumption, primarily due to its large agricultural sector (Market Research Future, 2021).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="example">
                    <h3>Key Players</h3>
                    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Major companies in the nitric acid industry include <strong>BASF</strong>, <strong>Yara International</strong>, and <strong>CF Industries</strong>.  
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> These companies dominate the market, producing millions of tons of nitric acid annually to meet global demand.  
                    <strong>Example:</strong> BASF alone produces over <strong>2 million tons</strong> of nitric acid each year, serving industries worldwide (BASF Annual Report, 2022).</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>2. Cost Efficiency</h2>
            <div class="examples">
                <div class="example">
                    <h3>Production Costs</h3>
                    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The Ostwald Process is highly efficient, with a conversion rate of <strong>90–95%</strong> for ammonia to nitric acid.  
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> This efficiency reduces production costs, making nitric acid affordable for large-scale industrial use.  
                    <strong>Example:</strong> The cost of producing nitric acid is approximately <strong>$200 per ton</strong>, making it one of the most cost-effective industrial chemicals (Chemical Economics Handbook, 2020).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="example">
                    <h3>Energy Consumption</h3>
                    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The process requires significant energy input, primarily for heating and maintaining high pressures.  
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> Innovations in energy-efficient technologies have reduced energy consumption by <strong>20%</strong> over the past decade (International Energy Agency, 2021).  
                    <strong>Example:</strong> Modern nitric acid plants use heat recovery systems to recycle energy, further lowering operational costs (Energy Efficiency Journal, 2022).</p>

            <h2>3. Job Creation</h2>
            <div class="examples">
                <div class="example">
                    <h3>Direct Employment</h3>
                    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The nitric acid industry supports thousands of jobs worldwide, from production to distribution.  
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> These jobs contribute to local economies and provide stable employment opportunities.  
                    <strong>Example:</strong> In the United States, the chemical manufacturing sector, including nitric acid production, employs over <strong>500,000 people</strong> (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2021).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="example">
                    <h3>Indirect Employment</h3>
                    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> The industry also creates indirect jobs in logistics, engineering, and research and development.  
                    <strong>Impact:</strong> These jobs further stimulate economic growth and innovation.  
                    <strong>Example:</strong> The global fertilizer industry, which relies heavily on nitric acid, supports over <strong>1 million jobs</strong> worldwide (FAO, 2020).</p>
