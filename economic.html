            <p>The <strong>Ostwald Process</strong>, while important for industrial production, has enormous economical effects. Some of them are listed and analyzed below:</p>

            <h2>Advantages</h2>

                    <h3>Market Growth</h3>
                    <p>Market size shows and indicates how important and valued the nitric acid production
                        is globally. The global nitric acid market was valued at approximately 
                        USD 31.0 billion in 2023 by BussinesWire (2024) and is predicted to reach USD 37.8 
                        billion by 2030. In just 7 years, the market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate 
                        (CAGR) of 2.9%. This growth is driven by
                        increasing demand from fertilizer manufacturers for nitric acid, neccessary component of their product. 
                        Market Growth provides financial incentives for the producers, which will be able to supply more 
                        fertilizers. This will contribute to the global agricultural productivity, 
                        helping to solve the problem of feeding the population.

                    <h3>Industrial Versatility</h3>
                    <p>
                        Nitric acid is used to produce not only fertilizers, but also other products as well. 
                        For instance, nitric acid is needed to produce the toluene 
                        di-isocyanate (TDI), which is important for manufacturing flexible 
                        polyurethane foams. This foam may be met in transportation, furniture, and 
                        carpet underlay spheres. Globally, the demand for nitric acid, combining
                        all of its uses, reached approximately
                        57 million tonnes in 2022 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 2.12% until 2032.
                        This shows the significant role of nitric acid in fostering economic growth not in 
                        some limited area, but globally.

                    <h3>High Production Costs</h3>
                    <p>
                        Producing nitric acid involves Ostwald Process. As it was shown before,
                        it is complext process, which requires a lot of expenses, particularly 
                        raw materials and energy. Ammonia, a primary 
                        resource, is synthesized using natural gas, which can account for 
                        more than the half of the total production costs. For instance, nitric acid price 
                        of $350 per ton is necessary 
                        to achieve a 10% internal rate of return (IRR) with a plant 
                        capital expense of $500 per ton per annum capacity (TSE, 2022). This isn't cheap process,
                        it requires significant amount of investment from manufacturers.

                    <h3>Environmental Compliance Expenses</h3>
                    <p>
                        Production of nitric acid produces a lot of environmental waste. 
                        Producers need to adjust to the global requirements and norms to keep their 
                        manufacturing clean. However, this also leads to additional 
                        expenses and increase the cost of production. For instance, 
                        in the UK, the total cost of compliance, including the installation 
                        of abatement technology and its maintenance, was estimated at 
                        £27.8 million (EMR, n.d.). Inside this sum, £9.8 million is for abatement technology, while 
                        £113,000 is for annual maintenance and compliance activities. Consequently, 
                        expensive process of production of nitric acid becomes even more financially
                        difficult with those mandatory norms and activities.
