            <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">To start with, <strong>the Ostwald Process</strong> is one of the most important industrial chemical processes, discovered by Wilhelm Ostwald in 1902. It allowed for the more widespread production of <strong>nitric acid (HNO₃)</strong>, chemical, which is used in production of fertilizers, explosives, and other processes.</p>

            <h2>Wilhelm Ostwald: The Pioneer</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">Wilhelm Ostwald (1853–1932) was a chemist from Germany. 
                He is very important figure for the chemistry in 20th century. 
                He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1909 for his work
                 on catalysis, chemical equilibrium, and reaction velocities. 
                 His discovery was very useful for the manufacturers and producers.</p>

            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">During the times of his discovery or at the start of 20th century, there was growing need for 
                for fertilizers, because of increasing human population, and explosives, due to war. 
                The Haber Process, another significant chemical process, gave a way to synthesize ammonia
                from nitrogen. While the Ostwald Process expanded upon this achievemnt by 
                producing nitric acid from ammonia, allowing for large-scale 
                production of fertilizers and explosives.</p>

            <h2>Impact on Industry</h2>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 50px;">The Ostwald Process took the main role in production of nitric acid.
                By 1959, global nitric acid production reached <strong>3 million tons annually</strong>,
                 and today it has reached <strong>60 million tons</strong> (Astronautix, n.d., Fine, 2023).
                 Later, when Green Revolution happened, the Ostwald Process was at its forefront.
                 It helped to increase agricultural productivity 
                 and to feed a growing global population.</p>
