            <p>The <strong>Ostwald Process</strong>, while important for industrial production, has significant environmental effects. Below are the key environmental implications of production of Nitric Acid.</p>

            <h2>Advantages</h2>

                    <h3>1. Essential for Agriculture and Soil Fertility</h3>
                    <p>As we mentioned before, Nitric acid (HNO₃) is one of the most 
                        crucial part in modern-day agriculture, predominantly for its 
                        use in synthetic fertilisers including ammonium nitrate and ammonium 
                        calcium nitrate. According to The Essential Chemical Industry (2016), 
                        about 80% of nitric acid goes for making fertilizers that positively 
                        affects the soil fertility. Nitric acid-derived fertilizers are 
                        actually effective due to its high nitrogen content, which is essential
                         for plant growth. And nitrogen is a crucial micronutrient necessary 
                         for chlorophyll production, protein synthesis, and overall plant 
                         growth. Nitric acid in these fertilisers is critical for enhancing 
                         crop yield and soil nutrient balance , so it affects the environmental
                          factor significantly in a positive way.

                    <h3>2. Industrial and Manufacturing Benefits </h3>
                    <p>Nitric acid is widely used in industries such as explosives 
                        manufacturing (for mining and construction), metal refining,
                         and polymer production.This reduces dependence on more hazardous 
                         or inefficient chemical alternatives, making industrial processes
                          more effective.</p>

                <div class="example">
                    <h3>Climate Change Contribution </h3>
                    <p>Nitrous oxide (N2O) is released into the atmosphere during 
                        the compound's synthesis using the Ostwald manufacturing process.
                         With more than 265 times the warming effect of an equivalent 
                         volume of carbon dioxide, this material is a powerful greenhouse 
                         gas (Hunter, 2023). According to the Global Carbon Project, global
                          anthropogenic N₂O emissions have risen by approximately 40% from
                           1980 to 2023, with agricultural activities being the primary 
                           contributors.

                    <p>
                        Moreover, according to (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], 1998), 
                        N2O is an ozone depleting substance which reacts with O3 
                        in both the troposphere (i.e., below 10,000 feet above sea level)
                         and in the stratosphere (50,000 - 150,000 feet).  The released gas
                          from such large productions of nitric acid contributes to changes
                           in the climate, increasing environmental adversities in the form
                            of rising global temperatures, shifting of weather patterns, and
                             increased events of extreme meteorological calamities.
