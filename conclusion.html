            <p>The Ostwald Process is a cornerstone of modern industrial chemistry, ensuring the global production of nitric acid (HNO₃). This process has revolutionized industries such as agriculture and explosives, while also having significant economic and environmental impact.</p>

            <h2>Summary of Key Points</h2>
            <div class="examples">
                <div class="example">
                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>The Ostwald Process was developed by <strong>Wilhelm Ostwald</strong> in 1902 and has since become a vital method for producing nitric acid. Ostwald was awarded the <strong>Nobel Prize in Chemistry</strong> in 1909 for his contributions to catalysis and chemical equilibria (Smith et al., 2020).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="example">
                    <h3>Ostwald Process</h3>
                    <p>The process involves three main stages: <strong>primary oxidation</strong>, <strong>secondary oxidation</strong>, and <strong>absorption</strong>. It converts ammonia (NH₃) into nitric acid under controlled conditions, using a platinum-rhodium catalyst (Johnson, 2018).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="example">
                    <h3>Real-Life Examples</h3>
                    <p>Nitric acid is used in the production of <strong>fertilizers</strong>, <strong>explosives</strong>, <strong>industrial chemicals</strong>, and <strong>pharmaceuticals</strong>. For example, ammonium nitrate fertilizers have increased global crop yields by <strong>40–60%</strong> (FAO, 2019).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="example">
                    <h3>Economic Factor</h3>
                    <p>The global nitric acid market is valued at <strong>$10 billion</strong>, with major players like BASF and Yara International dominating the industry. The process is highly efficient, with a conversion rate of <strong>90–95%</strong> (Grand View Research, 2021).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="example">
                    <h3>Environmental Factor</h3>
                    <p>The process releases <strong>nitrogen oxides (NOₓ)</strong> and contributes to <strong>water pollution</strong> through nitrate runoff. However, innovations like catalyst optimization and renewable energy have reduced emissions by <strong>30%</strong> (International Energy Agency, 2021).</p>

            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>The Ostwald Process has played a pivotal role in addressing global challenges such as <strong>food security</strong> and <strong>industrial growth</strong>. However, balancing its economic benefits with environmental sustainability remains a critical challenge for the future. Continued innovation and responsible practices will be essential to minimize its environmental impact while maximizing its industrial potential.</p>
